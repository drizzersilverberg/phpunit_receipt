## What Is Unit Testing ?
* Software testing method
* Individual units of source code tested
* Determines whether code is fit for use

### Unit Testing (Generally)
Unit testing is testing isolated units of code to ensure correctness.

### What's a unit of code?
A single function or code

### Test-Driven Development
* Write Test
* Run Test
* Write Code
* Run Test
* Repeat until completed

### TDD Pattern
Similar to: [http://www.agiledata.org/images](http://www.agiledata.org/images)

## Why Unit Test?
* Ensure code works correctly
* Additional documentation
* Reduces the chance of bugs
* Improves the ability to refactor
* Helps to write better designed code

### Ensure Code Works
* Test are run multiple times.
* Test first, code changed second.

### Additional Documentation
* How to use a method
* Typical and unusual scenarios

### Reduce Bugs
* TDD produces less bugs

#### Quality Improvement with TDD
* 40%-90% defect density decrease
* 15%-35% initial development time increase

#### Agile Software Development Using TDD
* Increased quality
* Ease of coding
* More focused planning and design
* Enabled timely feedback
* Less bugs with TDD

### TDD improves your ability to refactor your code
### TDD forces you to write better designed software

## Automated Unit Testing VS Manual Testing

### Automated Unit Testing
* Similar to conventional testing by hand
* Automated tests
* Isolated tests
* No forgotten or missed tests

`Special cases are the bane of manual testing`
`Unit testing is faster than manual testing`
`Unit Testing and TDD is not a silver bullet`

### Other Types of Testing
* Integration
Test the integration of your software
* Functional
Ensure the functions of your application
* Behavior
Test series of step to ensure some behavior in the application is correct
* Acceptance
Typically done by stakeholders to ensure application meets the designed requirement
